# **Incident Response Plan (IRP) Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides a structured approach for implementing an **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** in **DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and Zero Trust environments**. It outlines **detection, response, mitigation, and recovery strategies**, ensuring compliance with **NIST 800-53, CMMC, and FedRAMP** security frameworks.

## **What is an Incident Response Plan (IRP)?**
An **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** is a formalized process for **detecting, containing, analyzing, and mitigating cybersecurity incidents** to minimize operational disruption and data breaches.

### **Key Benefits of an IRP:**
- **Rapid containment and mitigation of security incidents.**
- **Ensures compliance with DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and CMMC standards.**
- **Enhances security posture through proactive threat intelligence.**
- **Reduces impact and recovery time for critical systems.**

## **Incident Response Plan (IRP) Lifecycle**

### **1. Preparation**
✅ Establish an **Incident Response Team (IRT)** with defined roles & responsibilities.
✅ Implement **Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) for real-time monitoring**.
✅ Conduct **tabletop exercises and Red Team/Blue Team simulations**.

### **2. Detection & Analysis**
✅ Deploy **intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS) to identify threats**.
✅ Use **threat intelligence feeds (MITRE ATT&CK, OpenCTI) for correlation**.
✅ Classify incidents based on severity, impact, and affected assets.

### **3. Containment**
✅ Isolate compromised systems to prevent further spread.
✅ Implement **Zero Trust segmentation and Just-In-Time (JIT) access controls**.
✅ Notify key stakeholders and prepare regulatory reports if required.

### **4. Eradication & Remediation**
✅ Remove malware, unauthorized access, or malicious artifacts.
✅ Patch vulnerabilities and update security configurations.
✅ Perform forensic analysis to identify root causes and attack vectors.

### **5. Recovery & Restoration**
✅ Validate system integrity before restoring operations.
✅ Monitor affected systems for any signs of persistence or reinfection.
✅ Conduct post-incident reviews to improve response strategies.

### **6. Lessons Learned & Continuous Improvement**
✅ Document the **incident response timeline, findings, and mitigation actions**.
✅ Update **security policies, procedures, and playbooks**.
✅ Conduct **post-mortem reviews to improve future incident handling**.
