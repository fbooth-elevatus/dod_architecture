# **Security Risk Assessments Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides best practices for conducting **Security Risk Assessments (SRA)** in **DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and Zero Trust environments**. It outlines **risk identification, assessment methodologies, compliance requirements, and recommended tools** to enhance security posture and mitigate cyber threats.

---

## **What is a Security Risk Assessment?**
A **Security Risk Assessment (SRA)** is a structured process used to **identify, analyze, and mitigate security risks** associated with IT infrastructure, cloud environments, and applications. It helps ensure compliance with **NIST 800-53, CMMC, FedRAMP, and Zero Trust frameworks**.

### **Key Benefits of Security Risk Assessments:**
- **Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses before exploitation.**
- **Ensures compliance with DoD, FedRAMP, and NIST security mandates.**
- **Reduces risk through proactive threat modeling and analysis.**
- **Enhances overall security resilience with automated risk assessments.**

## **Security Risk Assessment Process**

### **1. Risk Identification**
✅ Identify **assets, data flows, and critical system components**.
✅ Conduct **threat modeling using MITRE ATT&CK and STRIDE frameworks**.
✅ Map security risks to compliance frameworks (NIST 800-53, CMMC, FedRAMP IL4+).

### **2. Risk Analysis & Impact Assessment**
✅ Perform **vulnerability assessments using Nessus, OpenVAS, AWS Inspector**.
✅ Classify risks based on impact, likelihood, and exploitability.
✅ Evaluate **potential financial, operational, and reputational impact.**

### **3. Risk Mitigation & Remediation Planning**
✅ Prioritize risks using **Risk Scoring Frameworks (CVSS, FAIR, NIST RMF).**
✅ Develop mitigation strategies based on **Zero Trust, microsegmentation, and IAM controls**.
✅ Automate security remediation using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security policies**.

### **4. Continuous Monitoring & Risk Reassessment**
✅ Deploy **SIEM & continuous security monitoring (Splunk, AWS Security Hub, Azure Sentinel).**
✅ Conduct **automated security compliance scans & penetration testing.**
✅ Update risk assessments based on **new threat intelligence and evolving attack techniques**.
