# **Vulnerability Management Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides best practices for implementing **Vulnerability Management** in **DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and Zero Trust environments**. It outlines **risk-based vulnerability identification, remediation strategies, compliance requirements, and recommended tools** to strengthen cybersecurity resilience.

## **What is Vulnerability Management?**
**Vulnerability Management (VM)** is the continuous process of **identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities** in cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.

### **Key Benefits of Vulnerability Management:**
- **Reduces the attack surface by proactively mitigating security gaps.**
- **Ensures compliance with DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and NIST 800-53 standards.**
- **Improves risk visibility with automated vulnerability assessments and reporting.**
- **Enhances security posture through continuous monitoring and remediation workflows.**

## **Vulnerability Management Lifecycle**

### **1. Discovery & Asset Inventory**
✅ Conduct **automated asset discovery** for servers, applications, containers, and endpoints.
✅ Maintain an **up-to-date asset inventory** with risk classification.
✅ Use **continuous vulnerability scanning** to detect misconfigurations and security flaws.

### **2. Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Prioritization**
✅ Perform **automated vulnerability scans using CVSS and risk-based prioritization**.
✅ Utilize **threat intelligence feeds (MITRE ATT&CK, CISA KEV, OpenCTI)** for risk scoring.
✅ Identify vulnerabilities in **open-source dependencies and third-party components.**

### **3. Remediation & Risk Mitigation**
✅ Establish a **patch management process** for high-risk vulnerabilities.
✅ Automate **configuration hardening using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) policies**.
✅ Apply **Zero Trust security principles** to limit exposure and lateral movement.

### **4. Continuous Monitoring & Compliance Enforcement**
✅ Deploy **SIEM & real-time threat monitoring (Splunk, AWS Security Hub, Azure Sentinel)**.
✅ Integrate **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) for rapid incident mitigation**.
✅ Conduct **periodic penetration testing and red team exercises to validate security controls**.
