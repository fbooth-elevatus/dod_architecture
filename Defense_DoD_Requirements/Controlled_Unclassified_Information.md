# **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Protection Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides best practices for protecting **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** in **DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and Zero Trust environments**. It outlines **data classification, security controls, compliance requirements, and recommended tools** to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of CUI.

---

## **What is Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)?**
**CUI** is sensitive but unclassified information that requires protection per **NIST 800-171, CMMC, and DoD security policies**. It includes **contractual, technical, financial, and personally identifiable information (PII)** related to government and defense operations.

### **Key Benefits of CUI Protection:**
- **Prevents unauthorized access and data leaks.**
- **Ensures compliance with DoD, NIST 800-171, and FedRAMP IL4+ mandates.**
- **Strengthens cybersecurity posture through encryption and access controls.**
- **Supports Zero Trust security by continuously monitoring and enforcing data policies.**

## **CUI Protection Best Practices**

### **1. Data Classification & Labeling**
✅ Identify and label **CUI per NIST 800-171 guidelines**.
✅ Use **automated data classification tools (Microsoft Purview, AWS Macie, Boldon James)**.
✅ Implement **metadata tagging for structured and unstructured data**.

### **2. Access Control & Identity Management**
✅ Enforce **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**.
✅ Implement **CAC/PIV authentication for government personnel and contractors**.
✅ Require **multi-factor authentication (MFA) for CUI access**.

### **3. Encryption & Secure Storage**
✅ Encrypt CUI at rest and in transit using **FIPS 140-2/140-3 validated encryption**.
✅ Store CUI in **DoD-approved cloud environments (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, GCP Assured Workloads)**.
✅ Implement **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for encryption key management**.

### **4. Secure Sharing & Collaboration**
✅ Use **DoD-approved collaboration tools (DISA milCloud, Microsoft 365 GCC High)**.
✅ Apply **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies to restrict unauthorized sharing**.
✅ Enable **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) to validate secure connections**.

### **5. Continuous Monitoring & Incident Response**
✅ Deploy **SIEM solutions for real-time CUI activity monitoring (Splunk, Chronicle, AWS Security Hub)**.
✅ Implement **auditing and logging for CUI access and modifications**.
✅ Establish an **incident response plan (IRP) for CUI breaches and leaks**.
