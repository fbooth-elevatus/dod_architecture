# **DevSecOps for High Impact Level Applications**

## **Purpose**
This document provides guidance on implementing **DevSecOps** best practices for **Impact Level (IL) applications** in **Department of Defense (DoD) and FedRAMP environments**. It outlines security frameworks, compliance requirements, and DevSecOps automation techniques to support **IL4, IL5, and IL6 cloud architectures**.

---

## **Key Areas of Focus**

### **Security & Compliance for Impact Level Applications**
- **DoD Impact Level (IL) Classifications:** IL2, IL4, IL5, IL6
- **FedRAMP Compliance:** Low, Moderate, and High baselines
- **NIST 800-53 & NIST 800-171 Security Controls**
- **CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification)**
- **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for DoD Applications**
- **FIPS 140-2/140-3 Encryption Standards**
- **Continuous Authorization to Operate (cATO)**

### **DevSecOps Security Automation**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, Ansible, AWS CloudFormation
- **Secure CI/CD Pipelines:** GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Security Scanning:** SAST/DAST (SonarQube, Checkmarx, OWASP ZAP)
- **Container Security:** Kubernetes, Docker, runtime security (Aqua, Prisma Cloud)
- **Compliance as Code:** AWS Config, Azure Policy, OpenSCAP
- **Software Supply Chain Security:** SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

### **Identity, Access, and Network Security**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
- **CAC/PIV Authentication & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Secure API Gateways & Service Mesh Security (Istio, Linkerd)**
- **Network Segmentation & Microsegmentation**
- **Zero Trust Access Control for DoD Applications**

### **Threat Monitoring & Incident Response**
- **Security Information & Event Management (SIEM):** Splunk, Azure Sentinel, Chronicle
- **Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS)**
- **Automated Threat Intelligence & Behavioral Analytics**
- **Incident Response Playbooks for DoD Cloud Applications**
- **Continuous Monitoring & Security Logging**

## **Implementation Best Practices**
1. **Align DevSecOps with DoD IL4-IL6 security requirements**
2. **Automate security compliance with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
3. **Embed security in CI/CD pipelines for DoD cloud environments**
4. **Implement Zero Trust security models for impact-level workloads**
5. **Enable real-time threat detection & security monitoring**
6. **Enforce software supply chain security for mission-critical applications**

---

## **Next Steps**
- **Ensure FedRAMP High & IL5+ compliance** for cloud-native applications.
- **Harden CI/CD pipelines** with automated security testing.
- **Implement continuous monitoring & proactive threat hunting**.
- **Integrate AI-driven security analytics** for DoD application defense.
