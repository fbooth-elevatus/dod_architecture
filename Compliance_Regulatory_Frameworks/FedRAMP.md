# **FedRAMP Compliance Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides an overview of the **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)**, a standardized approach to **security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring** for cloud products and services used by federal agencies. It outlines compliance requirements, security controls, and best practices for achieving **FedRAMP High and DoD IL4+ compliance**.

---

## **What is FedRAMP?**
**FedRAMP** is a government-wide program that standardizes security controls for cloud services, ensuring they meet **NIST 800-53 security requirements**. It enables **Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** to obtain authorization to operate (ATO) within federal environments.

### **FedRAMP Authorization Levels**
| **Level** | **Data Sensitivity** | **Examples** |
|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| **Low** | Public & Non-Sensitive Data | Public Websites, Basic Collaboration Tools |
| **Moderate** | Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) | Federal Business Applications, SaaS Solutions |
| **High** | Mission-Critical & Highly Sensitive Data | DoD, Law Enforcement, Healthcare, National Security |

### **Key Benefits of FedRAMP Compliance**
- Provides a **standardized security framework** for cloud services.
- Reduces **risk and cost** by leveraging a unified compliance approach.
- Ensures **continuous monitoring** and risk management.
- Facilitates **authorization reciprocity** across federal agencies.

## **FedRAMP Compliance Process**
To achieve FedRAMP authorization, CSPs must follow a **multi-step process**:

### **1. Pre-Assessment & Readiness**
✅ Identify applicable **FedRAMP Impact Level (Low, Moderate, High)**.
✅ Perform a **gap analysis** using NIST 800-53 security controls.
✅ Select a **Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)** for readiness assessment.

### **2. Security Package Development**
✅ Prepare the **System Security Plan (SSP)** documenting security policies.
✅ Develop the **Authorization Boundary Diagram** defining system components.
✅ Implement security controls, encryption (FIPS 140-2), and access management.

### **3. Independent Security Assessment**
✅ Conduct a **full security assessment with a 3PAO**.
✅ Perform **penetration testing and vulnerability scanning**.
✅ Address any **security deficiencies and remediation actions**.

### **4. Authorization to Operate (ATO)**
✅ Submit **security package to Joint Authorization Board (JAB) or agency sponsor**.
✅ Review findings and obtain **FedRAMP Provisional ATO (P-ATO) or full ATO**.
✅ Implement **continuous monitoring and compliance tracking**.

## **FedRAMP Security Controls & Compliance Mapping**
FedRAMP aligns with **NIST 800-53 Rev. 5** security controls, categorized into key domains:

### **1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
✅ Implement **RBAC, ABAC, and CAC/PIV authentication**.
✅ Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
✅ Integrate **Zero Trust security model** for cloud access.

### **2. Data Security & Encryption**
✅ Ensure **FIPS 140-2/140-3 encryption for data-at-rest & in-transit**.
✅ Deploy **HSM-based Key Management Systems (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault)**.
✅ Implement **Tokenization & Data Masking** for sensitive information.

### **3. Continuous Monitoring & Incident Response**
✅ Deploy **SIEM solutions (Splunk, AWS Security Hub, Azure Sentinel)**.
✅ Automate **compliance validation with AWS Config, Azure Policy**.
✅ Implement **Incident Response Plans (IRP) and real-time threat detection**.

### **4. Secure DevSecOps & Compliance Automation**
✅ Use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for secure deployments**.
✅ Enforce **CI/CD pipeline security scanning (SAST, DAST)**.
✅ Implement **Continuous ATO (cATO) for real-time compliance**.
