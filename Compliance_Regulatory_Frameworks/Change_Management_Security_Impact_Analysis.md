# **Change Management & Security Impact Analysis (SIA) Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides a structured approach to **Change Management and Security Impact Analysis (SIA)** for **DoD, FedRAMP, IL4+, and Continuous ATO (cATO) environments**. It outlines best practices for ensuring that all system changes are **assessed, documented, and validated** against security compliance requirements.

## **What is Change Management & Security Impact Analysis (SIA)?**
**Change Management** is the structured process of planning, approving, and implementing changes in IT environments, ensuring security, compliance, and operational stability.

**Security Impact Analysis (SIA)** evaluates how changes affect **security controls, risk posture, and compliance** with frameworks such as **FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, CMMC, and DoD IL4+**.

### **Objectives of Change Management & SIA**
- Ensure **controlled and documented changes** to cloud and software architectures.
- Identify **potential security risks** before implementing system modifications.
- Maintain **FedRAMP, CMMC, and IL4+ compliance** through structured assessments.
- Integrate **automated security testing** within **DevSecOps CI/CD pipelines**.

## **Change Management Process**
To manage security-sensitive changes effectively, follow a **structured change approval process**:

### **1. Change Request & Documentation**
✅ Identify the **proposed change** and affected systems.
✅ Document **justification, scope, and security implications**.
✅ Assign a **Change Control ID** and log it in the **Change Management System (CMS)**.

### **2. Security Impact Analysis (SIA)**
✅ Evaluate **potential risks and security control modifications**.
✅ Conduct **vulnerability assessments** on affected components.
✅ Perform **compliance validation (FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, IL4+, CMMC)**.
✅ Assess **Zero Trust & access control impacts**.

### **3. Risk Mitigation & Change Approval**
✅ Define **risk mitigation strategies & rollback plans**.
✅ Obtain **Change Control Board (CCB) or Risk Management approval**.
✅ Execute **controlled test deployments in staging environments**.

### **4. Change Implementation & Security Validation**
✅ Deploy changes using **secure CI/CD pipelines**.
✅ Implement **runtime security scanning & compliance monitoring**.
✅ Verify changes with **penetration testing and security audits**.

### **5. Continuous Monitoring & Documentation**
✅ Maintain **audit logs of all changes & security assessments**.
✅ Conduct **post-implementation review & lessons learned**.
✅ Automate **continuous monitoring using SIEM tools**.

## **Security Impact Analysis (SIA) Best Practices**
1. **Automate Security Compliance Checks** – Use **AWS Config, Azure Policy, OpenSCAP**.
2. **Integrate Change Validation in DevSecOps Pipelines** – Apply **SAST, DAST, IAST security testing**.
3. **Use Risk-Based Approvals for High-Impact Changes** – Implement **Zero Trust risk assessments**.
4. **Monitor Security Controls Continuously** – Deploy **SIEM, SOAR, and threat detection tools**.
5. **Enforce Role-Based Change Management Access** – Apply **RBAC/ABAC for privileged modifications**.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Develop a Change Management & SIA Policy** – Standardize security risk assessments for system changes.
2. **Automate Compliance & Risk Validation** – Integrate **security-as-code & DevSecOps testing**.
3. **Enhance Cloud Security Posture** – Ensure **Zero Trust enforcement & real-time monitoring**.
4. **Align with DoD & FedRAMP Guidelines** – Map change management controls to **NIST 800-53, IL4+, and CMMC Level 3+**.
