# **DoDAF Diagrams for Secure Cloud Architecture**

## **Purpose**
This document provides **DoDAF (Department of Defense Architecture Framework) diagrams** for **secure cloud architecture and DevSecOps** in **DoD and FedRAMP environments**. These diagrams illustrate key security concepts, system interactions, compliance standards, and operational workflows.

---

## **OV-1: High-Level Operational Concept Graphic**
### **Description**
This diagram provides an overview of the **DoD Cloud Security Architecture**, showing the interaction between **mission systems, security gateways, identity management, compliance monitoring, and cloud workloads**.

### **Diagram Components**
- **DoD Mission System** → Primary system interacting with cloud infrastructure.
- **Zero Trust Security Gateway** → Enforces authentication and access control.
- **Cloud Service Providers (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, GCP Assured Workloads)** → Hosts workloads securely.
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** → Controls user access with CAC/PIV authentication.
- **SIEM & Threat Intelligence** → Monitors security events and logs.
- **DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline** → Automates security enforcement during software deployment.
- **Cloud Workloads (Kubernetes, Serverless, VMs)** → Hosts applications securely.
- **Compliance Monitoring (FedRAMP, IL4+)** → Ensures regulatory compliance.

## **OV-2: Operational Resource Flow Diagram**
### **Description**
This diagram details **data flows, API security, and identity management interactions** within the **DoD cloud environment**.

### **Diagram Components**
- **DoD User** → Interacts with cloud applications.
- **CAC/PIV Authentication** → Ensures identity validation.
- **Identity Provider (Azure AD, Okta)** → Manages authentication.
- **API Gateway (AWS API Gateway, Kong)** → Secure API access control.
- **Zero Trust Security Gateway** → Prevents unauthorized access.
- **Cloud Applications (SaaS/PaaS)** → Processes data securely.
- **Cloud Data Storage (FIPS 140-2 Encrypted)** → Stores classified data securely.
- **SIEM & Threat Intelligence** → Monitors and detects anomalies.

## **SV-1: System Interface Description**
### **Description**
This diagram shows **cloud security components and system interactions**, mapping **security tools, identity providers, and compliance monitoring**.

### **Diagram Components**
- **Cloud Security Gateway** → Protects cloud workloads.
- **Cloud IAM (AWS IAM, Azure AD, GCP IAM)** → Manages user identities.
- **Cloud Workloads (Kubernetes, Serverless, VMs)** → Hosts applications.
- **API Security Gateway** → Controls API interactions.
- **Compliance Automation (FedRAMP, IL4+)** → Enforces security policies.
- **SIEM & Security Analytics** → Detects and mitigates threats.
- **DevSecOps Pipeline** → Automates security validation.
- **Cross-Domain Security (DoD Networks)** → Enables secure DoD connectivity.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Enhance DoDAF Integration** – Incorporate additional architecture views for **SV-5 (Operational System Mapping)** and **StdV-1 (Security Standards Overview).**
2. **Automate Compliance Mapping** – Use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security validation**.
3. **Develop Graphical Representations** – Create **detailed UML-like diagrams** for system interactions.
4. **Ensure Continuous Compliance Monitoring** – Utilize **FedRAMP & DoD-approved security automation tools**.
