# **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides an overview of the **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)** framework, which establishes security standards for protecting **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** within **Department of Defense (DoD) supply chains**. It outlines **CMMC levels, compliance requirements, and security best practices** for cloud and software architectures.

---

## **What is CMMC?**
**CMMC** is a **DoD cybersecurity framework** that standardizes security practices for **contractors, subcontractors, and vendors** handling **CUI and Federal Contract Information (FCI)**. It aligns with **NIST 800-171, FedRAMP, and Zero Trust** principles.

### **CMMC 2.0 Maturity Levels**
CMMC consists of three maturity levels:

| **Level** | **Security Scope** | **Applicable Organizations** |
|----------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| **Level 1 (Foundational)** | Basic safeguarding of **Federal Contract Information (FCI)** | Small contractors with low-risk data exposure |
| **Level 2 (Advanced)** | Protection of **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** | Contractors handling CUI, aligned with **NIST 800-171** |
| **Level 3 (Expert)** | Advanced threat protection for **high-value DoD programs** | Large contractors supporting **critical defense operations** |

## **CMMC Compliance Process**
To achieve **CMMC compliance**, organizations must follow a **structured assessment and certification process**:

### **1. Pre-Assessment & Readiness**
✅ Determine **CMMC maturity level required** for your contracts.
✅ Conduct a **gap analysis** against **NIST 800-171 security controls**.
✅ Establish **access controls, encryption, and network segmentation**.

### **2. Security Implementation & Documentation**
✅ Implement **Identity & Access Management (IAM) with RBAC/ABAC**.
✅ Enforce **FIPS 140-2 encryption for data-at-rest and in-transit**.
✅ Develop a **System Security Plan (SSP) and Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)**.

### **3. CMMC Assessment & Certification**
✅ Engage a **CMMC Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO)**.
✅ Perform **security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning**.
✅ Address **non-compliance findings and submit security documentation**.

### **4. Continuous Monitoring & Compliance Maintenance**
✅ Deploy **SIEM solutions (Splunk, Azure Sentinel, Chronicle, AWS Security Hub)**.
✅ Implement **continuous compliance monitoring (cATO, automated reporting)**.
✅ Conduct **regular cybersecurity awareness training** for employees.

---

## **CMMC Security Controls & Compliance Mapping**
CMMC aligns with **NIST 800-171 and NIST 800-53** security controls across multiple domains:

### **1. Access Control (AC)**
✅ Implement **RBAC, ABAC, CAC/PIV authentication**.
✅ Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
✅ Restrict **remote access & privileged user management**.

### **2. Data Security & Encryption**
✅ Encrypt **data-at-rest and data-in-transit using FIPS 140-2**.
✅ Use **HSM-based Key Management Systems (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault)**.
✅ Implement **Zero Trust data access policies**.

### **3. Risk Management & Incident Response**
✅ Establish **incident response plans (IRP) with automated remediation**.
✅ Deploy **behavioral analytics & real-time threat intelligence**.
✅ Conduct **regular tabletop exercises and penetration testing**.

### **4. Secure DevSecOps & Compliance Automation**
✅ Use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for secure deployments**.
✅ Automate **CI/CD security scanning (SAST, DAST, SBOM verification)**.
✅ Implement **Continuous ATO (cATO) for real-time compliance tracking**.
