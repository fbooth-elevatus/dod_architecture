# **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (Secure SDLC) Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides best practices for implementing a **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (Secure SDLC)** in **DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and DevSecOps environments**. It outlines security controls, compliance requirements, and recommended tools for ensuring **secure software design, development, testing, and deployment**.

---

## **What is Secure SDLC?**
A **Secure SDLC** integrates security into every phase of software development, ensuring that **security vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated early**. It aligns with **Zero Trust, NIST 800-53, CMMC, and FedRAMP High** security standards.

### **Key Benefits of Secure SDLC:**
- **Reduces security risks** by integrating security from design to deployment.
- **Automates security testing** within CI/CD pipelines.
- **Ensures compliance with DoD, FedRAMP, and industry security frameworks**.
- **Enhances software supply chain security** and prevents vulnerable dependencies.

## **Secure SDLC Phases & Best Practices**

### **1. Secure Planning & Requirements Gathering**
✅ Define **security & compliance requirements (FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, CMMC)**.
✅ Implement **Threat Modeling (STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK) for risk assessment**.
✅ Establish **Zero Trust security principles for software design**.

### **2. Secure Software Design & Architecture**
✅ Enforce **least privilege access control for application services**.
✅ Use **cryptographic best practices (FIPS 140-2, TLS 1.3, AES-256 encryption)**.
✅ Apply **secure coding guidelines (OWASP Top 10, NIST SSDF)**.

### **3. Secure Coding & Development**
✅ Automate **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with SonarQube, Checkmarx**.
✅ Enforce **dependency scanning (Snyk, Trivy, OWASP Dependency-Check)**.
✅ Implement **Code Signing & SBOM validation (SPDX, CycloneDX, Sigstore)**.

### **4. Security Testing & Validation**
✅ Perform **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite**.
✅ Conduct **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) to detect runtime threats**.
✅ Implement **fuzz testing, API security validation, and penetration testing**.

### **5. Secure Deployment & DevSecOps Integration**
✅ Use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security tools (Terraform Sentinel, OpenSCAP)**.
✅ Implement **Zero Trust CI/CD pipeline enforcement (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins)**.
✅ Deploy security-hardened containers with **runtime protection (Falco, Aqua Security, Prisma Cloud)**.

### **6. Continuous Monitoring & Incident Response**
✅ Integrate **SIEM & Security Analytics (Splunk, AWS Security Hub, Azure Sentinel)**.
✅ Automate security alerts & responses with **SOAR platforms (IBM Resilient, XSOAR)**.
✅ Continuously assess **software vulnerabilities (NVD, VulnDB, CISA KEV list)**.
