# **Secure CI/CD Pipeline (SecCICD) Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides best practices for implementing **secure Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines** in **DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and cloud security environments**. It outlines security controls, compliance requirements, and recommended tools to ensure secure software delivery and automated compliance validation.

---

## **What is Secure CI/CD (SecCICD)?**
Secure CI/CD integrates **security controls into software development pipelines**, ensuring that **code, infrastructure, and deployments** meet security and compliance standards **before production release**.

### **Key Benefits of Secure CI/CD:**
- **Automated security scanning** at every stage of development.
- **Prevention of misconfigurations** in infrastructure as code (IaC).
- **Continuous compliance validation** for DoD, FedRAMP, and NIST standards.
- **Threat detection & response** through security telemetry and logging.

## **Secure CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices**

### **1. Implement Security in Each Stage of CI/CD**
✅ **Code Commit & Source Control Security**
   - Use **signed commits (GPG, Sigstore)** to ensure code integrity.
   - Enforce **branch protection policies** in GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
   - Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using **Snyk, Dependabot, or Trivy**.

✅ **Build Security**
   - Use **AWS CodeBuild, Azure DevOps, or Google Cloud Build** with security scanning.
   - Harden build containers and use **immutable infrastructure**.
   - Implement **signed container images & software provenance tracking**.

✅ **Testing & Security Validation**
   - Automate **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with SonarQube, Checkmarx**.
   - Integrate **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite**.
   - Perform **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) validation** to track dependencies.

✅ **Deployment Security**
   - Enforce **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security validation** (Terraform, Ansible, AWS Config).
   - Implement **role-based access controls (RBAC) for deployments**.
   - Use **service mesh security (Istio, Linkerd) for workload isolation**.

✅ **Continuous Monitoring & Response**
   - Monitor logs using **SIEM solutions (Splunk, Azure Sentinel, AWS Security Hub)**.
   - Detect runtime threats with **Falco, Aqua Security, or Sysdig Secure**.
   - Automate rollback & remediation with **SOAR (IBM Resilient, Palo Alto XSOAR)**.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Develop a Secure CI/CD Strategy** – Define security policies for each pipeline stage.
2. **Automate Compliance & Security Enforcement** – Integrate **automated security testing & monitoring**.
3. **Enhance Cloud Security Posture** – Deploy **Zero Trust-based security controls** in pipelines.
4. **Achieve IL4+ and FedRAMP Readiness** – Map security controls to **NIST 800-53, CMMC, and DoD IL4+ standards**.
