# **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides best practices for securing **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** deployments in **DoD, FedRAMP, and IL4+ environments**. It outlines security controls, automation strategies, and compliance requirements for ensuring **secure, repeatable, and scalable cloud infrastructure**.

---

## **What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the process of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through **machine-readable configuration files** instead of manual processes. This enables organizations to **automate infrastructure deployment** while integrating security and compliance at every stage.

### **Key Benefits of IaC Security:**
- **Automates security enforcement** across cloud workloads.
- **Reduces misconfigurations** through standardized infrastructure templates.
- **Ensures compliance with DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and Zero Trust policies**.
- **Enhances CI/CD pipeline security** with integrated security scanning.

## **Security Best Practices for IaC**

### **1. Secure Configuration Management**
✅ **Use Version Control (Git, GitLab, Bitbucket) for IaC scripts**.
✅ **Define immutable infrastructure** to prevent unauthorized changes.
✅ **Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for IaC repositories**.

### **2. Automate Security Scanning in CI/CD Pipelines**
✅ **Scan Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation templates for security misconfigurations**.
✅ Use **static analysis tools (Checkov, TFLint, KICS) to validate infrastructure security**.
✅ Integrate **CI/CD pipeline security validation (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD)**.

### **3. Enforce Policy as Code & Compliance Standards**
✅ **Use Open Policy Agent (OPA), Sentinel, and AWS Config for compliance enforcement**.
✅ Map security controls to **FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, CMMC, and DoD IL4+ requirements**.
✅ Implement **automated compliance validation** before deployment.

### **4. Secure Secrets & Key Management**
✅ Store secrets securely using **AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault**.
✅ Rotate encryption keys regularly and enforce **FIPS 140-2 encryption**.
✅ Limit access to **environment variables and configuration files**.

### **5. Continuous Monitoring & Drift Detection**
✅ Implement **automated drift detection to track unauthorized changes**.
✅ Use **SIEM solutions (Splunk, Azure Sentinel, AWS Security Hub) for infrastructure monitoring**.
✅ Log all IaC-related activities for **audit and forensic analysis**.
