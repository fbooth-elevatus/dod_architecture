# **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides a comprehensive guide to **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** solutions for securing **DoD, FedRAMP, and IL4+ cloud environments**. It outlines **EDR capabilities, security best practices, compliance requirements, and recommended tools** for proactive threat detection and response.

## **What is EDR?**
**Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** is a security framework that continuously monitors and analyzes endpoint activities to detect, investigate, and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real time. EDR enhances **Zero Trust security**, ensuring continuous threat detection across **workstations, servers, cloud workloads, and containerized environments**.

### **Key Benefits of EDR:**
- **Real-Time Threat Detection** – Identifies and mitigates advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- **Behavioral Analytics & Anomaly Detection** – Uses AI/ML to recognize suspicious activity.
- **Automated Threat Response** – Provides immediate isolation and remediation actions.
- **Forensic Investigation & Incident Analysis** – Captures endpoint activity for compliance audits.
- **Zero Trust Integration** – Enforces least privilege and continuous endpoint monitoring.

## **EDR Security Controls & Compliance Alignment**
EDR solutions align with key compliance frameworks, including:

### **1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
✅ Enforce **RBAC & ABAC-based access control policies**.
✅ Enable **Zero Trust & continuous authentication** for endpoint access.
✅ Integrate with **CAC/PIV authentication for DoD compliance**.

### **2. Threat Detection & Behavioral Analysis**
✅ Deploy **AI/ML-driven anomaly detection** for endpoint behavior.
✅ Use **MITRE ATT&CK framework** for **TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) mapping**.
✅ Monitor file, process, and network activity to detect **insider threats & malware**.

### **3. Continuous Monitoring & Incident Response**
✅ Integrate **SIEM & SOAR platforms** (Splunk, Azure Sentinel, Chronicle, AWS Security Hub).
✅ Automate **threat containment, host isolation, and attack remediation**.
✅ Perform **forensic data collection** for threat hunting & incident analysis.

### **4. Compliance & Security Hardening**
✅ Ensure **FIPS 140-2/140-3 encryption for endpoint communications**.
✅ Map EDR policies to **NIST 800-53, CMMC, and FedRAMP IL4+ security controls**.
✅ Implement **Zero Trust endpoint protection & microsegmentation**.
