# **Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) Guide**

## **Purpose**
This document provides best practices for implementing **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** in **DoD IL4+, FedRAMP, and Zero Trust environments**. It outlines security controls, compliance requirements, and recommended tools for **real-time threat detection and response**.

---

## **What is IDS/IPS?**

### **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
**IDS monitors network traffic** for suspicious activities and **alerts security teams** to potential threats. It is **passive** and does not actively block attacks.

### **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**
**IPS actively blocks malicious traffic** by enforcing security rules, preventing **unauthorized access, exploits, and cyberattacks** in real time.

### **Key Differences Between IDS & IPS**
| **Feature** | **IDS (Detection)** | **IPS (Prevention)** |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Function** | Monitors & logs threats | Blocks malicious traffic in real-time |
| **Deployment Mode** | Out-of-band (passive) | Inline (active) |
| **Response Action** | Alerts security teams | Stops & mitigates attacks automatically |
| **Use Case** | Security monitoring & forensics | Network protection & Zero Trust enforcement |

## **IDS/IPS Security Best Practices**

### **1. Deploy Network & Host-Based IDS/IPS**
✅ Use **Network IDS/IPS (NIDS/NIPS)** for cloud & on-prem security.
✅ Deploy **Host-Based IDS (HIDS) for endpoint protection**.
✅ Monitor **North-South & East-West traffic** to detect lateral movement.

### **2. Implement Zero Trust & AI-Based Threat Detection**
✅ Enforce **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) with IDS/IPS validation**.
✅ Use **AI-driven behavioral analysis to detect anomalies**.
✅ Apply **signature-based & anomaly-based detection for layered security**.

### **3. Automate Incident Response & Threat Intelligence**
✅ Integrate IDS/IPS with **SIEM (Splunk, Azure Sentinel, AWS Security Hub)**.
✅ Automate response actions with **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools**.
✅ Utilize **MITRE ATT&CK framework** for threat correlation & adversary detection.

### **4. Ensure Compliance with DoD & FedRAMP Standards**
✅ Implement **FIPS 140-2 encryption for network data protection**.
✅ Enforce IDS/IPS policies aligned with **NIST 800-53, CMMC, and FedRAMP IL4+**.
✅ Enable **real-time compliance reporting & security event auditing**.

## **IDS/IPS Compliance & Security Frameworks**
| **Framework** | **IDS/IPS Compliance Requirements** |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **NIST 800-53 Rev 5** | SC-7 (Boundary Protection), SC-26 (Application Layer Filtering), SC-7(10) (Network Traffic Analysis) |
| **FedRAMP High & IL4+** | Continuous network monitoring & automated threat response |
| **CMMC Level 3** | Threat intelligence integration & anomaly detection |
| **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** | Microsegmentation & continuous security validation |

## **Top IDS/IPS Security Tools & Technologies**
| **Category** | **Tools & Solutions** |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| **Network IDS/IPS (NIDS/NIPS)** | Snort, Suricata, Palo Alto Threat Prevention, AWS Network Firewall |
| **Host-Based IDS/IPS (HIDS/HIPS)** | OSSEC, Wazuh, CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender ATP |

## **Next Steps**
1. **Develop an IDS/IPS Security Strategy** – Define **network & endpoint security policies**.
2. **Automate Threat Detection & Response** – Integrate IDS/IPS with **AI-driven analytics**.
3. **Enhance Cloud Security Posture** – Deploy **Zero Trust IDS/IPS enforcement**.
4. **Achieve IL4+ and FedRAMP Readiness** – Map IDS/IPS security to **NIST 800-53, CMMC, and Zero Trust frameworks**.
