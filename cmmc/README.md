# **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Overview**

## **Purpose**
This document provides a detailed overview of the **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)** framework and how it applies to cloud-based systems such as **SecureCloudX SaaS**, ensuring compliance with **DoD IL4+**, **FedRAMP High**, and **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** protection requirements.

---

## **1. What is CMMC?**
The **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)** is a unified standard developed by the **U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)** to ensure **Defense Industrial Base (DIB)** contractors implement adequate cybersecurity practices to protect **CUI**.

### **Key Goals:**
- **Safeguard CUI in non-federal systems.**
- **Reduce risk from cyber threats across the DIB.**
- **Implement a tiered model of cybersecurity maturity.**

## **2. CMMC Levels Overview**

| **Level** | **Name**                     | **Focus**                                                                 |
|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Level 1  | Foundational                 | Basic safeguarding of FCI (Federal Contract Information)                 |
| Level 2  | Advanced                     | NIST SP 800-171 implementation for CUI protection                        |
| Level 3  | Expert                       | Advanced practices for protecting CUI and reducing APT (Advanced Persistent Threats) |

> Note: As of CMMC 2.0, Levels 2 and 3 require third-party assessments or government-led assessments.

## **3. CMMC Domains**
CMMC controls are grouped into **14 domains** aligned with **NIST 800-171** and **NIST 800-172** standards:

- Access Control (AC)
- Asset Management (AM)
- Audit and Accountability (AU)
- Awareness and Training (AT)
- Configuration Management (CM)
- Identification and Authentication (IA)
- Incident Response (IR)
- Maintenance (MA)
- Media Protection (MP)
- Personnel Security (PS)
- Physical Protection (PE)
- Risk Management (RM)
- Security Assessment (CA)
- System and Communications Protection (SC)

## **4. SecureCloudX CMMC Alignment Strategy**
### **4.1 Alignment with CMMC Level 2 (Advanced)**
✅ Implementation of all **110 controls from NIST 800-171 Rev 2**.
✅ Protection of **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)**.
✅ Enforced **Zero Trust Architecture** for continuous verification.
✅ Encryption at rest and in transit using **FIPS 140-2 validated encryption**.

### **4.2 Compliance Practices in Place**
- **RBAC/ABAC** access control with MFA and CAC/PIV authentication.
- **SIEM integration** for audit, logging, and incident response.
- **Automated patch and vulnerability management** (e.g., Qualys, AWS Inspector).
- **Security awareness training and insider threat prevention.**
- **POA&M tracking and remediation documentation.**

---

## **5. CMMC Assessment & Readiness**
### **Pre-Assessment Activities**
- Internal security self-assessment using **DoD Assessment Methodology**.
- Gap analysis against **NIST 800-171** requirements.
- Engagement with a **C3PAO (Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization)**.

### **Audit Preparation Checklist**
✅ Up-to-date **System Security Plan (SSP)**
✅ Detailed **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)**
✅ Evidence of control implementation (screenshots, policies, audit logs)
✅ Personnel training and incident response plans

---

## **6. Continuous Monitoring & CMMC Sustainment**
- Continuous monitoring of CUI access and system events.
- Real-time SIEM alerts and forensic logging.
- Quarterly risk assessments and POA&M reviews.
- Integration with **FedRAMP ConMon** and **DoD cATO** requirements.

---

## **7. Conclusion**
Achieving and maintaining **CMMC compliance** is critical for participation in DoD contracts involving **CUI**. SecureCloudX aligns its security architecture and operational practices with **CMMC Level 2 and Level 3** to ensure strong protection, regulatory alignment, and audit readiness.
