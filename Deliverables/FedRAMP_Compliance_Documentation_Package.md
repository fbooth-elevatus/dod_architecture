# **FedRAMP Compliance Documentation Package**

## **1. Introduction**
This document serves as the **FedRAMP Compliance Documentation Package** for the **SecureCloudX SaaS Platform**, a **multi-tenant cloud service hosted in AWS GovCloud**. It outlines the system’s **authorization boundary, security controls, continuous monitoring strategy, and compliance alignment** with **FedRAMP High, DoD IL4+, and NIST 800-53 Rev 5**.

### **1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this package is to:
- Provide **comprehensive documentation** for the FedRAMP authorization process.
- Detail **implemented security controls** and inherited services.
- Demonstrate compliance with **NIST 800-53, Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), and Continuous ATO (cATO)**.
- Outline the **continuous monitoring and risk management** approach.

## **4. Security Control Implementation & Compliance Mapping**
### **4.1 FedRAMP Control Mapping Table**
| **NIST 800-53 Control** | **FedRAMP High Requirement** | **Implemented Security Measures** |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **AC-2 (Account Management)** | User access must be reviewed every 90 days | IAM, RBAC, MFA, and Just-In-Time (JIT) access |
| **AC-6 (Least Privilege)** | Restrict system access to authorized users only | Zero Trust enforcement, AWS IAM Policies |
| **AU-6 (Audit Review & Analysis)** | Continuous logging and event correlation | Splunk, AWS Security Hub, Chronicle SIEM |
| **CM-3 (Configuration Management)** | Secure baseline configurations required | Hardened images, Terraform Sentinel, AWS Config |
| **IA-2 (Identification & Authentication)** | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required | CAC/PIV authentication, Okta, AWS IAM Identity Center |
| **IR-4 (Incident Handling)** | Automated threat detection & response | Palo Alto XSOAR, AWS GuardDuty |
| **RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning)** | Continuous vulnerability management | Nessus, Qualys, AWS Inspector |
| **SC-12 (Cryptographic Key Management)** | Enforce FIPS 140-2/140-3 encryption | AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault |
| **SI-4 (System Monitoring)** | Real-time anomaly detection required | MITRE ATT&CK, Recorded Future, OpenCTI |

---

## **5. Continuous Monitoring & Incident Response**
### **5.1 Security Monitoring Strategy**
✅ **Real-time security monitoring using SIEM and AI-driven anomaly detection**
✅ **Automated compliance scanning for NIST 800-53, CMMC, and Zero Trust adherence**
✅ **Regular penetration testing and red team assessments for security validation**

### **5.2 Incident Response & Remediation**
✅ **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) for rapid mitigation**
✅ **Automated security event logging with forensic analysis capabilities**
✅ **Periodic risk assessments & red-team exercises**

## **7. Conclusion & Next Steps**
This **FedRAMP Compliance Documentation Package** provides a structured approach to achieving **FedRAMP High and DoD IL4+ authorization**. The next steps include:
1. **Submission of the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) and System Security Plan (SSP).**
2. **Security assessment by the Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO).**
3. **Final review and approval by the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB).**
4. **Implementation of Continuous Monitoring and Compliance Enforcement.**
