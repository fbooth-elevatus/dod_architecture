# **FedRAMP Control Mapping Table**

## **Purpose**
This document provides a structured **mapping of security controls** from **NIST 800-53 Rev 5** to **FedRAMP High and DoD IL4+ requirements**. It aligns cloud security policies with **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), continuous monitoring, and automated compliance validation**.

## **1. Control Mapping Table**
| **NIST 800-53 Control** | **FedRAMP High Requirement** | **DoD IL4+ Implementation** | **Implemented Security Measures** |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **AC-2 (Account Management)** | User access must be reviewed every 90 days | Enforce CAC/PIV-based authentication | IAM, RBAC, MFA, and Just-In-Time (JIT) access |
| **AC-6 (Least Privilege)** | Limit system access to authorized users only | Role-based access enforcement | AWS IAM, Azure AD, Google IAM |
| **AU-6 (Audit Review & Analysis)** | Continuous logging and event correlation | Security monitoring with real-time SIEM | Splunk, Chronicle, AWS Security Hub, Microsoft Sentinel |
| **CM-3 (Configuration Management)** | Secure baseline configurations required | Implement hardened images and CI/CD security | Terraform Sentinel, AWS Config, Azure Policy |
| **IA-2 (Identification & Authentication)** | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required | CAC/PIV authentication for all privileged users | Okta, Duo Security, AWS IAM Identity Center |
| **IR-4 (Incident Handling)** | Automated threat detection and response | Security orchestration and SOAR integration | IBM Resilient, Palo Alto XSOAR, AWS GuardDuty |
| **RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning)** | Continuous vulnerability management | Automated scanning and remediation | Nessus, Qualys, AWS Inspector |
| **SC-12 (Cryptographic Key Management)** | Enforce FIPS 140-2/140-3 encryption | Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration | AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault |
| **SI-4 (System Monitoring)** | Real-time anomaly detection required | Continuous monitoring and threat intelligence | MITRE ATT&CK, Recorded Future, OpenCTI |

## **2. Security Control Implementation Details**
### **2.1 Access Control (AC)**
- **Enforce Zero Trust-based authentication and identity verification.**
- **Role-Based and Attribute-Based Access Control (RBAC/ABAC) policies applied.**
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all privileged accounts.**

### **2.2 Audit & Logging (AU)**
- **Centralized logging of all security events using SIEM solutions.**
- **Automated correlation of security incidents to detect anomalies.**
- **Continuous monitoring dashboards for FedRAMP and IL4+ compliance.**

### **2.3 Configuration Management (CM)**
- **Hardened OS images and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enforcement.**
- **Secure CI/CD pipeline with automated security checks.**
- **Regular baseline configuration audits to prevent drift.**

### **2.4 Incident Response (IR)**
- **SOAR integration for automated threat response workflows.**
- **Security Incident Response Plan (IRP) to align with FedRAMP requirements.**
- **Real-time forensic analysis and risk mitigation.**

### **2.5 Cryptographic Controls (SC)**
- **FIPS 140-2/140-3 encryption for data at rest and in transit.**
- **Key management via HSMs with automated key rotation.**
- **TLS 1.2+ enforcement for all network communications.**

## **3. Continuous Monitoring & Compliance Validation**
✅ **Real-time security monitoring using SIEM and AI-driven anomaly detection.**
✅ **Automated compliance scanning for NIST 800-53, CMMC, and Zero Trust adherence.**
✅ **Regular penetration testing and red team assessments for security validation.**

## **4. Next Steps**
1. **Align security policies with FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, and DoD IL4+ frameworks.**
2. **Implement automated compliance enforcement in CI/CD pipelines.**
3. **Deploy Zero Trust-based access controls across cloud and hybrid environments.**
4. **Enhance continuous monitoring capabilities with AI-driven threat intelligence.**
